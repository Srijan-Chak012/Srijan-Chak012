### Hullooo 👋

### Who am I? 🤗
I am Srijan Chakraborty, an undergraduate student at IIIT Hyderabad and welcome to my rollercoaster of my profile! I've tried to express myself and my various interests through my projects! I have tried to make projects related to football ⚽ (my favourite sport), music 🎵 (my favourite passtime) and politics 🗨️ (because everyone should have an opinion).

### What makes me, me? 😎 
I love learning new things 💙 and I try to get my hands dirty with everything that I learn... as long as it has good documentation though 👀! Over the last year or so, I have explored so many aspects of Computer Science and I am looking forward to continuing my journey into the world of programming! 😍
 
### What am I trying to do? 🤔
I have a few ideas (I like to call them my mega-projects) and am trying to explore as many things as I can before transforming my dreams and ideas into something more tangible. I hope to collaborate more on real-world projects and understand how to develop my visions into reality! 🤩

#### I just try to remember: Surviving and Celebrating can apparently go together 🥳
